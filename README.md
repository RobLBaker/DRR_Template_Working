# IMD_DRR_Template
This is a template project to for use when drafting a data release report. 

# Install from GitHub
remotes::install_github("nationalparkservice/IMD_DRR_Tempate")

# About this Template
This template is modeled after the Nature Science Data electronic journal (https://www.nature.com/sdata/), and contains an rmarkdown
template file, default folder structure for project files, and all necessary template files to generate a standard NPS-branded html 
report that documents the collection, processing, quality control, and evaluation of utility. 

This template is under active development to improve style and 508 compliance.

# Report outline
## Background & Introduction
The Background & Summary should provide an overview of the study design, the assay(s) performed, and the data generated, including any background information needed to put this study in the context of previous work and the literature, and should reference literature as needed. The section should also briefly outline the broader goals that motivated collection of the data, as well as their potential reuse value. We also encourage authors to include a figure that provides a schematic overview of the study and assay(s) design. 

## Methods
The Methods should include detailed text describing any steps or procedures used in producing the data, including full descriptions of the experimental design, data acquisition assays, and any computational processing (e.g. normalization, image feature extraction). See the detailed section in our submission guidelines for advice on writing a transparent and reproducible methods section. Related methods should be grouped under corresponding subheadings where possible, and methods should be described in enough detail to allow other researchers to interpret and repeat, if required, the full study. Specific data outputs should be explicitly referenced via data citation (see Data Records and Citing Data, below).

Authors should cite previous descriptions of the methods under use, but ideally the method descriptions should be complete enough for others to understand and reproduce the methods and processing steps without referring to associated publications. There is no limit to the length of the Methods section.

Authors are encouraged to consider creating a figure that outlines the experimental workflow(s) used to generate and analyse the data output(s) (Figure 1).

### Data Collection and Sample Processing Methods (optional)
Include a description of field methods and sample processing 

### Additional Data Sources (optional)
Provide descriptions (with citations) of other data sources used.

### Data Processing (required if done)
Summarize process and results of any QC processes done that manipulate, change, or qualify data.

### Code Availability (required)
For all studies using custom code in the generation or processing of datasets, a statement must be included in the Methods section, under the subheading "Code availability", indicating whether and how the code can be accessed, including any restrictions to access. This section should also include information on the versions of any software used, if relevant, and any specific variables or parameters used to generate, test, or process the current dataset. Actual analytical code should be provided in Appendices.

## Data Records (required)
The Data Records section should be used to explain each data record associated
with this work, including the repository where this information is stored, and
to provide an overview of the data files and their formats. Each external data
record should be cited as described below. A data citation should also be placed
in the subsection of the Methods containing the data-collection or analytical
procedure(s) used to derive the corresponding record.

Tables should be used to support the data records, and should clearly indicate
the samples and subjects (study inputs), their provenance, and the experimental
manipulations performed on each (please see example Tables below). They should
also specify the data output resulting from each data-collection or analytical
step, should these form part of the archived record.

## Data Quality Evaluation (required)
The Data Quality Evaluation section should present any analyses that are needed
to support the technical quality of the dataset. This section may be supported
by figures and tables, as needed. *This is a required section*; authors must
provide information to justify the reliability of their data. Wherever possible
& appropriate, data quality evaluation should be presented in the context of
data standards and quality control procedures as prescribed in the project’s
quality assurance planning documentation.

## Usage Notes (required)
The Usage Notes should contain brief instructions to assist other researchers
with reuse of the data. This may include discussion of software packages that
are suitable for analysing the assay data files, suggested downstream processing
steps (e.g. normalization, etc.), or tips for integrating or comparing the data
records with other datasets. Authors are encouraged to provide code, programs or
data-processing workflows if they may help others understand or use the data.

For studies involving privacy or safety controls on public access to the data,
this section should describe in detail these controls, including how authors can
apply to access the data, what criteria will be used to determine who may access
the data, and any limitations on data use.

## Acknowledgements (optional)
The Acknowledgements should contain text acknowledging non-author contributors.
Acknowledgements should be brief, and should not include thanks to anonymous
referees and editors or effusive comments. Grant or contribution numbers may be
acknowledged.

## References (required)
Bibliographic information for any works cited in the above sections, using the
standard *NPS NR Publication Series* referencing style.

In line with emerging [industry-wide standards for data
citation](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018259), references to all
datasets described or used in the manuscript should be cited in the text and
listed in the ‘References’ section in the same manner as a conventional
literature reference.
