Abstract Should go here. Multiple Lines are okay; it'll format correctly. Pay careful attendtion to non-standard characters, line breaks, carriage returns, and curly-quotes. You may find it useful to write the abstract in NotePad++ or some other text editor and not a word processor (such as Microsoft Word).


The Abstract should succinctly describe the study, the assay(s) performed, the resulting data, and their reuse potential, but should not make any claims regarding new scientific findings. No references are allowed in this section.
